# Frontend Assignment - Dashboard Design

This repository contains the frontend assignment for designing a dashboard. The project is built using modern web technologies and requires Node.js and npm to set up and run.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm is bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gokulgowtham/BCGXAssignment.git
    cd BCGXAssignment
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**: Install all the required dependencies by running:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. **Start the development server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    This will spawn a development server and automatically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:9000`.

## Accessing the Application

The application will be running on port `9000`.
